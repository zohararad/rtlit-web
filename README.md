# RTLit-Web

Online CSS left-to-right to right-to-left converter.

Takes CSS, LESS, SASS files and converts them from a left-to-right orientation to a right-to-left orientation. Useful when trying to convert English / Latin / LTR based stylesheets to support RTL languages like Hebrew / Arabic.

Uses the RTLit gem, which is available on [Github](https://github.com/zohararad/rtlit) and [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/rtlit)
